# Dummy Dork

### Setup

- Clone the GitHub repository by running the command
```
git clone https://github.com/koyaIrvin/dummy-dork.git
```
- Navigate to the root folder *dummy-dork*
- Run the command
```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Notes

- Ports 3000 and 3001 are used by the frontend and backend respectively; If these ports are currently used it might cause the application not to run
- Hovering on an image stays on that image and pauses the carousel
- If the browser window width is not already at least 1800px, resize or zoom to that level for a fun surprise
